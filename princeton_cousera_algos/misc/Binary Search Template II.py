# Template #2 is an advanced form of Binary Search. It is used to search 
# for an element or condition which requires accessing the current index 
# and its immediate right neighbor's index in the array.


# Key Attributes:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 	1. An advanced way to implement Binary Search.
# 	2. Search Condition needs to access element's immediate right neighbor
# 	3. Use element's right neighbor to determine if condition is met and 
# 	   decide whether to go left or right
# 	4. Gurantees Search Space is at least 2 in size at each step
# 	5. Post-processing required. Loop/Recursion ends when you have 1 element left.
# 	   Need to assess if the remaining element meets the condition.
	
	
# Distinguishing Syntax:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 	1. Initial Condition: left = 0, right = length
# 	2. Termination: left == right
# 	3. Searching Left: right = mid
# 	4. Searching Right: left = mid + 1
